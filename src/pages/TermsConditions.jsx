        <p className="mb-4">
          We currently deliver across Bangladesh. Orders are usually shipped
          within 5â€“7 business days. Delays may occur due to holidays, natural

          informed.

        <p className="mb-4">
          You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account.
          Cancellations made after billing will apply to the next month. Due to
